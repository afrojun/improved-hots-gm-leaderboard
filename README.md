# Improved HoTS Grand Master Leaderboard
Greasemonkey script to augment the Heroes of the Storm [grand master leaderboards](http://battle.net/heroes/en/leaderboards/).

The script currently has the following functions:
* Replace the 'wins' column with 'win/loss'
* Add a win percent column to the table
* Add a link to a search on hotslogs.com for each player's battletag
